# Applicant-Day-Lego-Web-App
 
A web app designed from the "Decisions & Disruptions" game found here: https://www.decisions-disruptions.org/. This web app was designed to remove the need for a lego game boards and dedicated game master, to allow small groups of students to play the game (with physical card deck) independantly.

For any issues, please contact me at n.henderson@uea.ac.uk. Please note that I have no affiliation with the team at https://www.decisions-disruptions.org/.
